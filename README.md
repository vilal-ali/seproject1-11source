# Task 2b
The goal of this task is to conduct a comprehensive code metrics analysis for the initial state of the project, utilizing appropriate tools such as CodeMR, Checkstyle, PMD, or any other tools deemed suitable. The analysis should provide insights into up to 6 key code metrics, and the implications of these metrics should be discussed. Additionally, consider how these metrics might guide decision-making processes for potential refactoring.

### Task Description:
- Code Metrics Analysis: Employ code analysis tools (e.g., CodeMR, Checkstyle, PMD) to extract up to 6 relevant code metrics for the project. These metrics may include but are not limited to: Cyclomatic Complexity, Code Duplication, NPathComplexity, Lines of Code and so on.
- Tools Used: Clearly state the tools used for the code metrics analysis and ensure that the selected tools provide a reliable and accurate representation of the project's codebase.
- Implications Discussion: For each identified metric, discuss its implications in the context of software quality, maintainability, and potential performance issues. Provide insights into how each metric reflects on the project's current state.
